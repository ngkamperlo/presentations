# Our Journey with Micro-Frontends at GWI

---

# Micro-Frontends at GWI

- The journey with MFEs began in 2019
- Neither the team nor the community had much experience with MFEs in a production environment

---

# Why Micro-Frontends?

- The ability to scale our codebase easily
- A single team can own a specific MFE, making teams more autonomous
- The risk of using a single new frontend technology can be contained

---

# The Benefit of Separate Deployments

- Establishes a cadence of deployments for each team
- Ensures deployments are not dependent on what the other teams do or deploy

---

# Challenges Faced with MFEs

- Instead of focusing on the benefits, we will discuss the problems we faced while implementing MFEs

---

# MFE Versioning: The Problem

- Updating an MFE to a new version and making the kernel/shell/platform aware of the latest version

---

# MFE Versioning: Issues

- We didn't need fully automated updates as it could add the wrong versions in production
- We didn't want a fully manual solution requiring a git commit to update a single MFE

---

# MFE Versioning: The Solution

- Creation of a service (frontend configuration) providing the kernel with the latest version of all MFEs
- A simple UI adding a new version of an MFE and updating all clients with the latest version

---

# Single Design System Challenges

- There isn't a single design system in place, instead, we have two implementations
- One for the React-based MFEs and another for the Elm-based MFEs

---

# Single Design System: Issues

- Hard to detect UI mismatches
- Changes made to the design system do not bubble up directly to all the MFEs
- Huge effort required to update UI libraries

---

# Common UI Components with Logic â€” Web Components

- The problem: MFEs had common pieces of functionality regardless of the technology used
- The solution: Implement functionality only once and wrap the output down to web components

---

# Communication with MFEs

- Communicate with each MFE by utilizing browser custom events
- Store the web components in an internal storybook for everyone to review

---

# Creating a Single-Page Mini App

- The need to create a single-page mini-app that was too small for a new MFE but too big for a web component

---

# Solution 1: BlackBox Pattern

- A black-box app that communicates with other applications only using custom events and renders and hides from the DOM as needed

---

# Solution 2: Web Component with Its Git Repository

- Due to patterns used in Elm-based apps, we decided to switch everything to `web components`

---

# MFE Communication

- Communication between MFEs isn't straightforward
- Module federation was introduced with Webpack 5 to make communication between MFEs easier

---

# Shared State Between MFEs

- We currently have a shared state between MFEs which is framework and library agnostic

---

# Future Focus Areas

- Module federation
- Updating frontend configuration with enhanced versioning functionality
- Storybook for the UI components without logic
- Auto-generation of API contracts in TypeScript interfaces/types
