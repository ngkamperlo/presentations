## Hands-Free Account Creation: Zero Clicks with AWS AFT

### Agenda
- History Lesson
- AWS Control Tower
- Control Tower + Terraform: AWS AFT Benefits
- AFT Architecture Overview
- AFT Workflow
- Core Services in AFT
- Custom Workflows in AFT
- AWS AFT Repositories Overview
- Key Points & Best Practices

# History Lesson

- **Initially AWS Landing Zone** AWS Landing Zone helped the users to setup multi account AWS environment with all the recommended best practices.
- **Later rebranded to AWS Control Tower** along with additional features - It provides a central management of multi account AWS organization.
- **AWS Control Tower does not come with an API** - a need was created to automate the whole process using IaC.
- **AWS Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)** automates the provisioning and management of AWS accounts.
- **Goal**: Enable **hands-free** account creation, management, and governance at scale using IaC.

---

# AWS Control Tower

- Automates setup of a **landing zone** for multi-account AWS environments.
- Centralized **identity management** for all accounts using AWS SSO.
- **Centralized logging** for CloudTrail and Config, directed to a logging account.
- **Guardrails** for preventive and detective controls applied to governed accounts.
- **Account Factory** for standardized, pre-approved account configurations.
- **Dashboard** enables administrators to:
  - View provisioned accounts across the enterprise.
  - Monitor controls for **policy enforcement**.
  - Detect policy **non-compliance** across accounts and OUs.
  - Organize noncompliant resources by account and organizational unit.

---

## Control Tower + Terraform: AWS AFT Benefits

### Terraform Overview

- Terraform: An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that streamlines cloud resource setup and management.
- AFT Module: Adds seamless integration of Terraform with AWS Account Factory for automated provisioning.

### Key Benefits of AWS AFT

- Hands-Free Provisioning: Automates the full account setup and lifecycle management, reducing manual steps.
- Scalable Governance: Enforces organizational standards across all accounts, ensuring consistency as you grow.
- Built-In Security & Compliance: Applies guardrails and compliance policies automatically, securing accounts from the start.

---

# AFT Architecture Overview

### Key Components

- **AWS Control Tower**: Manages landing zones and enforces governance.
- **Account Vending Machine (AVM)**: Automates account provisioning.
- **Customizations**: Lambda functions allow custom validation and configuration.

# AFT Workflow

### Steps of Account Creation

1. **Trigger Account Request**: Initiated by Terraform configuration.
2. **Validation**: Lambda functions validate account settings before creation.
3. **Provision Account**: The AVM provisions accounts automatically.
4. **Customization**: Apply custom configurations (policies, tags, etc.).
5. **Monitor Compliance**: Use AWS Config and Lambda to enforce rules.

---

# Core Services in AFT

### Services Supporting AFT

- **Lambda**: Runs custom code to extend account creation workflows.
- **SNS & SQS**: Event-driven messaging to trigger and monitor account provisioning.
- **DynamoDB**: Stores metadata on account configurations and status.

---

# Custom Workflows in AFT

### Customization Opportunities

- **Lambda Functions**: Extend validation or apply additional account settings.
- **Event-Driven Logic**: Use SNS and SQS to handle notifications and trigger additional processes.
- **Policy Management**: Apply custom IAM policies or compliance frameworks.

---

# AWS AFT Repositories Overview

1. **Account Request Repository (aft-account-request)** Main repository for Terraform account templates to trigger account provisioning workflows.
2. **Global Customizations (aft-global-customizations)** Applies standard resources or settings globally across all accounts.
3. **Account-Specific Customizations (aft-account-customizations)** Customize individual accounts based on organization needs.
4. **Provisioning Customizations (aft-account-provisioning-customizations)** Hooks into the account vending process to apply specific configurations during account setup.

---

# Points & Best Practices

### Key Takeaways

- **Automation**: Eliminate manual effort in account creation and governance.
- **Security & Governance**: Implement consistent security and compliance controls.
- **Customizable**: Adapt workflows using Terraform, Lambda, and SNS for organizational needs.
